Here's another principle I would like us to follow:  Alerts, whether they be pages or in slack, or whatever should be:
1. Informative
2. Actionable
3. Useful

If you can't hit all three of the above, DON'T BOTHER PEOPLE.

If it's a case of "We need something checking this periodically and notifying us if there's a problem, and if there is a problem, we want to see the history", that's what metrics and dashboards are for.

If your mechanism for 'monitoring' something is to look at it when you think about it, you're not monitoring.
