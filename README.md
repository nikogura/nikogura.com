Herein you'll find (hopefully) interesting tidbits that might be of use to you, and it's a good place for me to store my various rantings.

You'll also find my resume- in both an online long form and the more traditional condensed version.

Why is my resume posted online?  Well, I got sick of traditonal CV's and such where you make this blah blah blah list of hot keywords that you hope will help you make it past the filters.

I though, you know what?  I explain these various experiences so often to various people, wouldn't it be great if I could just link to it?  Better yet, what about having my fascinating journey through technology in a format where I didn't have to try to squash it down to n pages?

Joel Spolsky of [Joel On Software](https://www.joelonsoftware.com) fame wrote that documentation that nobody reads is useless, and therefore you had to make it easy on your readers.  This is advice I've taken to heart, and I always try to follow it.  To quote the late, great George Carlin, "My job is to entertain *and* inform."

So here it is.  I'm not giving away any sort of private information.  Everyone within earshot of me when a particular point was brought up has probably heard the stories enough to repeat them by heart.  

Sorry about that.  I can't resist a good story, even if the cashier at Chevron really doesn't want to hear about asymmetric encryption right now...
